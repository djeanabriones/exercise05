## Description

This is a contacts app where we can add and delete contacts, and the new additions and deletions will be reflected in the local contacts app of the phone or emulator.

## Challenges encountered

I had a hard time because the app shows 'Permission Denied', but I resolved it soon after. There was not much problems since the features to be added were already implemented in the previous exercises, so I just had to copy and modify it.

## Solutions

For the permission problem, I realized that I also had to give a write permission for the contacts. I had to add it to the manifest file and it's fixed.
